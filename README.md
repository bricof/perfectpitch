Machine learning app to recognize sounds as particular notes played by particular instruments.

The pyaudio library is used for reading in microphone audio. The numpy, scipy and sklearn libraries are used in the analysis. Two demos are included, one with matplotlib and the other with a flask.py server and d3.js. 

See the [blog post](http://briancoffey.ca/blogpost1.html) for an overview explanation. And see this [blog post on an Insight Data Science project](http://briancoffey.ca/blogpost7.html) for an app that builds on the ideas (though not much of the code) of this app.
